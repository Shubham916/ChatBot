Intelligent Chatbot with NLP and Machine Learning

Overview

This project is an intelligent chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The chatbot is deployed as an API using FastAPI and integrated with popular messaging platforms, including Slack and Telegram.

Features

Natural Language Processing: Utilizes NLTK and SpaCy for advanced text processing and analysis.
Machine Learning: Implements models using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras to enhance response accuracy.
API Development: Robust API built with FastAPI for seamless interaction.
Messaging Platform Integration: Real-time communication through Slack and Telegram integrations.

Usage

FastAPI Endpoints
    POST /chatbot/: Receive responses from the chatbot.
        Request Body: JSON containing the user's query.
        Response: JSON containing the chatbot's response.


Example Request

curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/chatbot/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Hello, chatbot!"}'

Example Response

{
  "response": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
}

Slack Integration

Create a Slack App and obtain the OAuth token.
Add the OAuth token to your .env file.
Set up the Slack events URL to point to http://yourserver/slack/events/.

Telegram Integration

Create a Telegram Bot using BotFather and obtain the API token.
Add the API token to your .env file.
Run the Telegram bot script:

python telegram_bot.py

Models and NLP

Natural Language Processing

NLTK: Used for tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
SpaCy: Used for entity recognition and dependency parsing.

Machine Learning
Scikit-learn: Used for training and evaluating ML models.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used for deep learning models (if applicable).
